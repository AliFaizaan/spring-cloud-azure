Spring is an open-source application framework developed by VMware that provides a simplified, modular approach for creating Java applications. Spring Cloud Azure is an open-source project that provides seamless Spring integration with Azure services.

The Azure Spring Cloud App Configuration Client Library loads configurations and feature flags from the Azure App Configuration service. The client library generates `PropertySource` abstractions, to match those already being generated by the Spring environment such as; Environment Variables, Command-line configurations, local configuration files, and so on.
