### Spring Cloud Stream Support

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

The framework provides a flexible programming model built on already established and familiar Spring idioms and best practices, including support for persistent pub/sub semantics, consumer groups, and stateful partitions.

Current binder implementations include:

- spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder-eventhubs
- spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder-servicebus
